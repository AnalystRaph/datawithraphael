**Project Title:** Earthquake Fatality Prediction â€“ Nepal 2015  

**Description:**  
This project focuses on predicting earthquake fatalities using data from the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze key factors contributing to casualties, such as building damage, location, and seismic intensity. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train various models, with performance evaluation metrics guiding model selection.  

**Key Features:**  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning model training and evaluation  
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
- Insights on disaster impact and potential applications for emergency response  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  

This project demonstrates the use of data science in disaster risk assessment and can aid in future earthquake response planning.
